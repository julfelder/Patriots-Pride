           <p id="textpara">Looking forward to next season, there are 10 games on lock for the Pats. I'm not even going to talk about the AFC East, Cleveland, LA ect. Now lets look at the real games. The Steelers are drooling at the thought of coming to Gillette and beating the patriots. They have a hell of alot of talent too. This will be a great game for sure. Seattle also has plenty of talent, even if their record didn't neccesarily reflect it last year. Russel Wilson may be a Herb off the field, but you can count on him to toss a couple long balls and have his recievers come up with them. Patriots should win this one, but it will be a good rematch of Suberbowl XLIX. The Ravens are rivals, and while they don't compare to the talent that is on New England, they somehow seem to always play the patriots close. Can't wait to see Brady throw up 40 against these crybabies. The bengas are a good team, and probably could have faced the Patriots in the AFC championship game last year if Andy Dalton was healthy. I'll be watching to see if they can repeat last season's sucesses. Arizona is a good team, despite being embarrased by the Panthers in the playoffs last year. With the addition of Chandler Jones to their defense, they will be a team to beat in the NFC provided they can find a suitable replacement for Larry Fitzgerald. Lastly, we have Denver. I am not too concerned about the denver offense, as of now to be led by Mark "buttfumble" Sanchez. But their defense led by Superbowl MVP Von Miller still worries me. Hopefully the Pats Offensive line can get their act togeather, as I am confident that if Brady isn't hit 20+ times in the game again it should be a lock.</p>
